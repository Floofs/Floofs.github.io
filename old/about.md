## About
I'm Connor (also known as Floofs), a programmer and pixel artist from the United States, as well as the author of this website.

I'm familiar with multiple programming languages, such as Java, C++, C#, HTML, and GML for Game Maker Studio 2.

I'm also very familiar with multiple art programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Krita, but the one I lean on the most is Aseprite for its usage in my pixel and game artwork.

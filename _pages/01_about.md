Here's a list of the coding languages that I know:

* HTML
* Java
* JavaScript
* GML

Most of the projects posted on my homepage are written in GML. Thanks to Game Maker Studio 2's workspace, I'm able to finish projects significantly quicker than I would otherwise.

I create all of my in-game spritework, but for controller prompts I use content from Open Game Art.

The music in my games are owned by their original owners, are used under their given licenses, and are given credit at the beginning of each game I use them in.

Hiya, I'm Connor! I make video games sometimes.
Here's a list of the coding languages that I know:

* HTML
* Java
* JavaScript
* GML

However, most of my works on here are made in GML, due to its runtime being easier to handle with teams of one, and the quicker
work speed it allows me.

If you'd like to contact me, check out my info up on the top of the website! You can't miss it.

Deserted Islanders is now released on itch.io!
You can download it [here] or at the embed at the bottom.

This prototype was part of a self-challenge to design and code a game concept within a week. I haven't done a Game Jam before, so this has been the closest thing so far.

The idea is to find three pieces of a raft with your party of three. However, you have only so many food rations, and the island you're on is dangerous - so you must be careful while also finding food along the way.

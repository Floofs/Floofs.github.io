I started this game back in late March of 2018, as part of my high school's Independent Study final project. Through quick work, I created 2 levels 
for each theme I decided on, and added a final platforming challenge level. This brought the total level count to 11, but they were really short levels.
To compensate, I added a hard mode which removes Krystal's scarf from her sprite, takes away the ability to charge your attack, and made you take double
the normal damage. <br/> <br/>
I also added little bits of flavor text as well for the pause menu, and the ability to check your controls on the fly. <br/>
At the end of the day, I'm happy with what I made in such short time, and I'm especially glad about the reviews. The main issue that people had with it
was the length (which I was well-aware of), and the lack of powerups and such. When working on future projects, I'll definitely keep this criticism
in mind.

The project itself uses concepts found on Sonic Retro's Sonic Physics Guide, but to make it clear: it isn't perfect.
Here's why:
- I used different values for the constants to make movement easier.
- I didn't use the sensor system that the 16-bit Sonic titles use.
- and I didn't implement all 4 'modes' for movement, just the main 'Floor' mode.

The gameplay is closer to the 8-bit Sonic titles as a result of these differences, but the goal was to prove that it was easy enough to create - not to be 1:1 perfect to the 16-bit titles. You can still get flung up walls like in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and it's possible to create a scripted loop system to replicate actual loop-de-loops (it's actually implemented already, it's just not in the uploaded build). It's how those older 8-bit titles handle the process, to the point that if you try to go back through those loops, it acts like a wall.

Give the uploaded build a try if you'd like!

Oh man, two days in a row?
You can check out the project page on GitHub here: [https://github.com/Floofs/PuyoInspired]

I talked a lot about how this works on a basic level earlier this year when I was still working on this project.
You can check that out [here].

Give the uploaded build a try if you'd like!

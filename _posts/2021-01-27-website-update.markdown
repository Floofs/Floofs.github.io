I went and updated the website again, to try and make it look better. For more info on it, I put the details in my /about page.

## 2020

So to sum up what happened this past year personally (outside of the global pandemic):
 - I'm currently in the second half of my second year of junior college.
 - I've been working out how to handle commissions as well as online payment 'stuff' to work on small future projects.
 - And I've been working on learning multiple different coding languages to get better at them, as well as become more proficient within GML.

## 2021

This year I'd like to work on more projects, and maybe some Game Jams.
There's plenty of ideas that I have so far, like puzzle games, platformers, RPGs, etc.

I also plan on doing write-ups on parts of projects I'm working on, which my last post should be an example of.
I won't be doing it for every little bit of course, but if it's something that I haven't seen written up before or very often, I'd like to pitch in some info on the ideas at least.

Finally, I'll be uploading some of my art here as a makeshift gallery, since it would help to add that to my portfolio. Keep in mind that most of this will be my usual pixel artwork!

There's plenty of work to do, so I'll be writing it all down to be worked on between classwork.
If there's any future updates to anything, I'll be sure to post it here. My GitHub is publically available, but most of my work is in private on there, since they're personal projects. If you need to contact me, I've got my /about page updated!

## About
I'm Connor (also known as Floofs), a programmer and pixel artist from the United States, as well as the author of this website.

I'm familiar with multiple programming languages, such as Java, C/C++ (multiple college classes), HTML (work in high school, as well as this website), and GML (Game Maker Language, which I primarily use to create my games). I plan on making a post to further delve into what I understand of these languages, outside of any projects.

I'm also very familiar with multiple art programs, but the one I lean on the most is Aseprite for its usage in my pixel and game artwork.

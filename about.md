My name is Connor Huckaby, and I'm a video game designer.
I'm currently in my second year of college, and I'm majoring in Software Engineering and Software Design.

You can contact me here: <a href="mailto:connor@huckaby.dev">connor@huckaby.dev</a>
You can see my projects and commits on my [GitHub] page.

My first finished project was [Krystal the Adventurer] back in June of 2018, and I released it on Steam with a development time of ~3 months. It's an old-school styled platformer that you can finish in about half an hour, and was my High School final project for Independent Study.
